# Random-Number-Crystal-Game
Can you defeat the magic crystals?

The world of the dinosaurs as they know it is ending unless you can stop it!

Using the four dino crystals, can you find a combo to match the meteor's trajectory and blow it off course? Good luck!

The app selects a random number and sets random values for the crystals. 

Should the user save the dinosaurs by finding the right combo to match the meteor, the app records a win and the game resets

Otherwise, the dinosaurs die and you lose, jerkface.
